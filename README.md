# Calculator

This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey through The Odin Project. The goal was to build a basic calculator, focusing on JavaScript logic and user interaction. The project emphasizes handling state, user input, and edge cases in a clean and predictable way.

## Project Overview

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It evaluates one operation at a time and supports chained calculations (e.g., 12 + 7 - 1 =). User input is handled through on-screen buttons for digits, operators, equals, and clear.

The project also accounts for common edge cases such as consecutive operators, division by zero, rounding long decimals, and fully resetting the calculator state when cleared.

## Skills Demonstrated
- JavaScript Logic: Built reusable functions and controlled application flow
- State Management: Tracked user input and calculator state
- DOM Manipulation: Updated the UI dynamically based on interactions
- Event Handling: Implemented responsive, event-driven user input
- Error Handling: Managed edge cases and prevented invalid operations
